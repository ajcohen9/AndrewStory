Once upon a time there was a boy named Tony. He always wanted to own a television but was poor and his family could not afford it. Therefore, Tony decided he was going to get a job to save up enough money to purchase a television himself. 


He chose to work in bestbuy. In this way, while he is working, he can also understand the price of the TV. As he wanted, he got the information about which televison is the cheapest.

A couple months later he finally had enough money to buy the exact TV that he wanted. When he got off of work he went to go grab the TV that he wanted to purchase, but there was one huge problem!

When he got home to set the TV up, it didn't turn on! Tony had bought a faulty computer. Sohe had to drive all the way back to Best Buy, return it, and get a new one. However, what Tony didn't realize was that he made a huge mistake.
